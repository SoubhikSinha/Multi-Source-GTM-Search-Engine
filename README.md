# Multi-Source GTM (Go-To-Market) Search Engine

## Acknowledgements
This project was built as part of a technical challenge from **[OpenFunnel](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/openfunnel)**, simulating a high-stakes engineering scenario. It draws deep inspiration from Anthropic‚Äôs [_Building Effective Agents_](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents), leveraging modular AI patterns like **Evaluator, Refiner**, and **Synthesizer agents.** Core tools such as **OpenAI APIs, NewsAPI**, and **FastAPI (with async orchestration, caching, and streaming)** powered the system‚Äôs intelligence and scalability. Sincere thanks to the challenge creators for a spec that encouraged real-world design thinking and thoughtful system architecture.

## Overview
**The Multi-Source GTM Research Engine** is a fully asynchronous, LLM-powered research system designed to uncover nuanced, multi-channel intelligence about companies ‚Äî including signs of technology usage, hiring intent, product expansion, and recent security events.

<br>

It accepts a single research goal and a list of company domains, then autonomously orchestrates:

-   **Query generation** across diverse surfaces (news, job boards, blogs, forums, LinkedIn, etc.),
    
-   **Parallel data collection** from real-time and cached sources,
    
-   **Result evaluation**, identifying weak signals and gaps,
    
-   **Query refinement**, and
    
-   **Final synthesis** into structured, confidence-scored insights.
    

  

The engine is modular, resilient, and inspired by agentic design principles such as those outlined in Anthropic‚Äôs _Building Effective Agents_. It simulates a team of virtual analysts working in harmony ‚Äî each focused on a precise role: strategist, executor, evaluator, refiner, and summarizer.

<br>

This is not just a tool for retrieving information ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **cognitive loop system** that mimics the judgment and feedback-driven refinement of a skilled human analyst, packaged into a scalable and inspectable backend service.

<br>


## Assumptions
### **üß± System & Language**
-   **Python 3.10+** is used, enabling modern type hinting (Literal, dataclass, etc.).
-   **FastAPI** is the framework of choice for async HTTP serving.
-   **aiohttp** is used instead of requests to support non-blocking I/O for all outbound calls.
-   **Environment configuration** is handled via .env files and dotenv.

### **üîê Authentication & API Keys**
-   API keys for **OpenAI**, **Google Custom Search**, and **NewsAPI** are securely accessed through os.getenv (dotenv).    
-   No access control/authentication layer is implemented at the FastAPI endpoint level (assumed to be behind internal auth or gateway in production).

### **üåê Input & Domain Assumptions**
-   **Input company_domains** is assumed to be a list of valid, reachable domains (no verification or sanitization done).
-   It is assumed that:
    -   Each domain has a meaningful homepage or /about, /blog page.
    -   Each domain is indexed by Google CSE.    
    -   Each domain may appear in LinkedIn or News sources.

### **üì° External Sources**
-   **Real API integrations** include:  
    -   Google CSE (customsearch/v1)    
    -   NewsAPI (/v2/everything)     
    -   LinkedIn (queried via Google site search site:linkedin.com/company/...)
-   **No crawling** beyond the homepage and 2 subpages is attempted.    
-   **Mocked fallback queries** are used when OpenAI responses cannot be parsed.

### **üîÅ Query Generation**
-   Queries are generated via **OpenAI Chat API**, guided by a system prompt with structured instructions.
-   A **fallback query** is inserted if LLM output is insufficient or unparsable.
-   Relevance scores from 0.0 to 1.0 are assumed to be meaningful and used for sorting/pruning.
-   The expand_queries method is only triggered when confidence falls below a threshold (e.g., 0.8).

### **ü§ñ Agent Pattern (Inferred / Optional)**
-   The architecture implicitly follows an **agentic orchestration pattern**:
    -   Strategy agent (Query Generator)
    -   Execution agent (SearchPipeline) 
    -   Evaluator agent (confidence scoring)
    -   Refiner agent (dynamic query re-invocation)
    -   Synthesizer agent (OpenAI summarizer)

### **‚öôÔ∏è Performance & Scaling**
-   All outbound calls (LinkedIn, NewsAPI, Google, Website) are made **in parallel via asyncio.gather()**.
-   The system enforces **concurrency limits** using asyncio.Semaphore(max_parallel).
-   **Timeouts** are set for every external call (8‚Äì10 seconds).
-   No persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL) is used ‚Äî only an **in-memory cache** is implemented (SimpleCache).
-   No pagination or scroll-based APIs are used ‚Äî all sources fetch a max of 3 results per query.

### **üí° Scoring & Confidence Logic**
-   Confidence scores are **naively computed** per module:
    -   Based on number of results/snippets.    
    -   Capped at 0.95.
    -   Floor values (e.g., 0.4‚Äì0.5) used when no signal is found.
-   Final confidence per company is **averaged** across successful modules only.    
-   Results with exceptions are excluded from synthesis unless expanded queries succeed.

### **üß™ Error Handling & Recovery**
-   All external calls are wrapped in safe_call() with:
    -   Retry mechanism (up to 2 retries).
    -   Timeout handling.
    -   Graceful degradation to zero-confidence fallback.
-   Failed modules (e.g., LinkedIn API fails) do **not break the pipeline**.

### **üîÑ SSE/Streaming**
-   SSE is **implemented manually** via StreamingResponse (no WebSocket used).
-   Stream sends:
    -   start ‚Üí per-domain result ‚Üí end events.
-   Parallelism is per-domain in streaming; each company is handled serially within the stream.

### **üìà Observability & Metrics**
-   Logging is enabled via logging.info and logging.error.
-   get_metrics() provides stats on:
    -   Cache hit rate
    -   Failed requests
    -   Total API calls
-   No external logging, tracing, or metrics pipeline is integrated (assumed to be internalized in prod).

### **üõ†Ô∏è Other**
-   No frontend included; assumed to be **headless API** backend.
-   Designed to be deployable in **lightweight environments** (e.g., Docker, single-node testing).
-   Not built for multi-tenant access, but easy to refactor for that.

## Architecture
The **Multi-Source GTM Research Engine** is architected as a modular, agent-inspired async pipeline that combines LLM reasoning, multi-channel evidence gathering, and real-time synthesis. The system balances **scalability**, **modularity**, and **fault tolerance** using the following layered architecture:

 - ### Key Agent Components
	 | Agent Role             | Responsibility                                                                |
	|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
	| QueryStrategyAgent     | Generates 8‚Äì12 diverse, high-signal queries across multiple sources           |
	| ExecutionAgent         | Runs all queries concurrently across APIs, CSE, and scrapers with backoff logic |
	| EvaluatorAgent         | Scores confidence, checks evidence sufficiency                                |
	| RefinerAgent           | Iteratively refines queries for domains with poor coverage                    |
	| SynthesisAgent         | Merges, deduplicates, and synthesizes insights from all evidence             |
 
 - ### **Core Architectural Features**
	 -   **Async First** : Built entirely on Python‚Äôs asyncio + aiohttp, with streaming support, timeouts, and semaphores for controlled parallelism.
	-   **LLM-Driven Strategy** : GPT-4o generates queries, expands them intelligently, and synthesizes final summaries‚Äîmimicking a human research analyst.
	-   **Tool-Agnostic Search Modules** : Each data source (News, LinkedIn, Website, Web Search) is encapsulated as a plug-and-play async module‚Äîeasy to extend or replace.
	-   **Smart Retry and Backoff** : Implements retry logic, confidence-based re-query, and exception-aware fault tolerance at every stage.
	-   **In-Memory Caching** : Lightweight SimpleCache system prevents duplicate API calls, supports quick prototyping, and logs hit-rates.
	-   **Streaming Support** : Built-in /research/stream endpoint provides real-time Server-Sent Events (SSE) for frontend integration or dashboards.
 
 - ### **Design Principles Followed**
	 - **Separation of Concerns**: Each module/agent has a single responsibility.
	 -   **Agentic Design**: Loosely coupled, feedback-loop driven agents as per Anthropic‚Äôs Effective Agents principles.   
	 -   **Fail-Soft Philosophy**: All errors gracefully degrade to structured fallback responses.   
	 -   **Scalability First**: Supports dozens of domains and 80+ searches in parallel with dynamic throttling.
 
 - ### **Example Flow (for: ‚ÄúFind companies using Kubernetes in production with recent security incidents‚Äù)**
	> **Step 1**: GPT-4o generates queries like:
	 - > site:linkedin.com kubernetes security engineer
	 - > site:company.com/blog kubernetes deployment
     - > devops job site:company.com
    > **Step 2**: All queries run in parallel across:
	 - > NewsAPI, LinkedIn, CSE, Web Scraping
	> **Step 3**: Evidence scored, weak results flagged
	> **Step 4**: Weak evidence ‚Üí Refined queries ‚Üí Retry
	> **Step 5**: Findings synthesized via LLM (JSON output)
